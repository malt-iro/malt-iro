## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in the intersections of linguistics and AI, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I focus on using large language models (LLMs) for automatic text simplification and paraphrasing. My goal is to develop models that aid comprehension and make complex language accessible to everyone.
